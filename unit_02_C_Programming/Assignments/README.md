# Assignments' File Naming Convention

an assginment file will be named using numbers and underscores only in which the numbers will describe lecture, assignment and exercise numbers and it will be in the format of:

`lectureNumber_assignmentNumber_ExerciseNumber.c`

For example:

`01_02_03.c`

In which `01` is the `lecture number` in this unit, `02` is the `assginment number` as the assignment can be divided into many parts and `03` is the `exercise number`.

>`NOTE:` any number will start from 01.
